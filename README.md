# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassifier
#  Iris Flower Classification with GUI (Logistic Regression)

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their physical measurements. It includes a **Tkinter GUI** for interactive predictions.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the popular [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv), which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target)
